# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- DMN adapter (decision tables → rule execution)
- AsyncAPI adapter (event contracts → subscriptions)
- DDL diff → incremental `ALTER TABLE` migrations
- `forma patch --dry-run` (edit-plan preview without writing)
- Forma Studio (per-standard visual editors)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-02

First public implementation. Full rewrite in Rust (the earlier TypeScript prototype was superseded).

Specification Federation: Forma organizes existing standards instead of inventing a DSL.

### Added
- `forma.yaml` manifest: spec inventory, standards/versions, build targets, identity bindings.
- Entity identity protocol: stable `forma://` URIs; binding priority `x-forma-entity` → manifest `bindings` → name conventions (`orders ≡ Order`).
- Adapters: SQL DDL (SQLite subset, hand-written parser), JSON Schema 2020-12, OpenAPI 3.1 (with `$ref` resolution), JSON Forms UI Schema, BPMN 2.0 subset (hand-written XML parser).
- Unified Semantic Graph with `affectedBy()` impact closure (forward `defines/binds/generates`, reverse `references/belongs-to`).
- Cross-standard doctor rules: `field-type-mismatch`, `field-required-mismatch`, `field-schema-missing`, `field-column-missing`, `field-name-style`, `form-binding-missing`, `workflow-reference-soft`, `table-entity-unbound`.
- Generators (deterministic, `@generated`-stamped): TypeScript interfaces + zero-dependency validators, Hono routes with request validation, SQLite baseline migration, React forms from JSON Forms layout.
- File-level incremental builds (`.forma/build.json`); manual edits to generated files are detected.
- Semantic Patch API (transactional): `add-entity-field`, `rename-entity-field`, `set-entity-field-required` — each propagated across SQL DDL, JSON Schema, OpenAPI and JSON Forms, then re-validated and incrementally rebuilt.
- CLI: `init` / `validate` / `doctor` / `graph` / `build` / `patch` / `mcp`.
- MCP stdio server (self-implemented JSON-RPC): `forma_validate`, `forma_graph`, `forma_impact`, `forma_patch`.
- End-to-end example project `examples/order-management` (5 standards + patch demo).
- 17 integration tests (`cargo test`).

### Changed
- Project language: TypeScript prototype → **Rust** (single binary serves CLI and MCP).
